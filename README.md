# NexLock 🔐

Smart Lock IoT System — Flutter client + ESP32 firmware.  
This is a public copy of a collaborative project originally developed in a private repository. Some internal assets and secrets are intentionally excluded.

---

## ✨ Features

- Mobile app (Flutter) to lock/unlock and view device status
- ESP32 firmware to drive the lock actuator and read sensors
- Secure, app-initiated commands with basic telemetry
- Multi-platform scaffolding (Android, iOS, Web, Desktop) already set up by Flutter tooling

> Tech mix in this public copy (approx.): Dart (Flutter), C/C++ (Arduino/ESP32), plus platform glue (CMake/HTML).

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Flutter** (3.x+) & **Dart** SDK installed
- **Android Studio** for mobile builds (as needed)
- **Arduino IDE** for the firmware build
- **Firebase** to store user and lock access data/events

## 🔌 Communication model (overview)

App → Device: lock/unlock commands sent over your chosen channel.

Device → App/Cloud: status updates (locked/unlocked).
